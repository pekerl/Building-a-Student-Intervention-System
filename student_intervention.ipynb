    "Decision Trees, SVM and Naive Bayes are appropriate for this problem. Decision Trees are used to predict classification problems by splitting the data in every step. Decision trees choose best features for us to split the data. It's easy to understand but everytime we split the data there is more possibility to overfit. Decision Trees work better for large datasets. Naive Bayes are another method for classification problems. We have to choose manually which features we have to use in Naive Bayes. They are not overfit easily like Decision Trees but they are hard to understand. Naive Bayes works better in small datasets. SVMs have better accuracy but longer training time. SVM works very well with good kernel even if the data is not linearly seperable. I chose decision trees because they are easy to interpret. I chose Naive Bayes because it's simple and give better results in small datasets. I chose SVM because it has high accuracy and it can work very well with an appropriate kernel. Decision Trees is used learning to diagnose medical cases and finance. Naive Bayes is used robotics and computer vision in most cases. SVM is often used for handwriting recognition and image classification."
